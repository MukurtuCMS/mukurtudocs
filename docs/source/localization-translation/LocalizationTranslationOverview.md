# Overview of localization and translation in Mukurtu 4.

**Translation** is (at the simplest level) converting words from one language to another. **Localization** is the process of adpating content and structure more exhaustively for another language.

## Translation



## Localization

- Configuration translation
- Interface translation
- Content translation

## General language use

- Mukurtu CMS fully supports Unicode character encoding, so if you can type your language, it should be accepted with no issue.
  - Note that this may require use of a language-specific keyboard. If you have any questions, please contact [Mukurtu Support](mailto:support@mukurtu.org) and we can provide you with resources and references to support this.
- Our default font is [BC Sans](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/policies-procedures/bc-visual-identity/bc-sans) as it has wide display coverage for many languages.
  - You can use a font of your choice if needed. **_DOCUMENTATION NEEDED_**
  - If you are wondering why text looks different now, Mukurtu CMS 3 used Helvetica Neue as the default font.

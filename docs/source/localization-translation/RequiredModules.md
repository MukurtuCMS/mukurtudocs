The following modules should already be included in a stock Mukurtu 4 build, and can be enabled from the front end of the site.

## Enabling required modules

2) Search for "translation". The three translation modules are grouped in the multilingual package.
3) Select all three modules and click "install".
4) Follow any remaining prompts.

Note: the Language module should already be installed. If in doubt, search for and install it in the same way.

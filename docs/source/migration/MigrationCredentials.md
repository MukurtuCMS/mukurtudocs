# Preparing Migration Credentials

Before you can run the migration, you will need to collect database credentials from your Mukurtu 3 site. We recommend doing this in advance of migration and recoding this information somewhere accessible so you can copy and paste it into your new Mukurtu 4 site when prompted.

The following database settings and credentials are required:
- Database type
- Database host
- Database name
- Database username
- Database password
- Document root for public files
- Document root for private files

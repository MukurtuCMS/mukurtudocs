# 2) Update Mukurtu 3 Site

You will need to update your Mukurtu 3 site to the [most current release](https://github.com/MukurtuCMS/mukurtucms/releases) to access the new pre-migration tools. This process is the same as recent minor version updates.
- Pre-migration tools were first included in the 3.0.7 release.

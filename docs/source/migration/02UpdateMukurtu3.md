# 2) Update Mukurtu 3 Site

You will need to update your Mukurtu 3 site to the [most current release](https://github.com/MukurtuCMS/mukurtucms/releases) to access the new pre-migration tools. This process is the same as previous updates. 

If you are hosting with Reclaim Hosting, see these instructions to update your site: [Updating a Reclaim Hosted Mukurtu CMS Site](https://mukurtu.org/support/updating-a-reclaim-hosted-mukurtu-cms-site/)

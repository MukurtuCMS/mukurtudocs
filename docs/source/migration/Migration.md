The migration steps will be displayed. You likely do not need to review these in depth, but the item counts should match your Mukurtu 3 site (eg: number of media assets by type, number of DH items). You may want to take a screenshot of these to comapre with the migration results.
When ready, click "Begin migration".

The migration will run, showing the progress as it goes. This may take some time to run, especially on large sites. 
DO NOT reload, refresh, close, or navigate away from this page until it is complete.

# Migration Overview

Migrating from a current Mukurtu 3 site to a new Mukurtu 4 site will be straightforward for most users. We have developed a set of migration tools that automate most of the migration steps.

The migration tools have been developed to migrate all site content. This does NOT extend to any theming, added modules, or other customization. Given the differences between Drupal 7 and Drupal 10, those will likely need to be recreated or a different module used.

> If you have made any of the following modifications to your Mukurtu 3 site, or believe that you will require additional migration support, please contact us at [support@mukurtu.org](mailto:support@mukurtu.org?subject=Mukurtu%204%20migration%20support) as the migration tool will not operate properly without modification.

> - Added, removed, or modified any content types.
> - Added, removed, or modified any Mukurtu features or tools.
> - Added, removed, or modified any Drupal 7 modules.

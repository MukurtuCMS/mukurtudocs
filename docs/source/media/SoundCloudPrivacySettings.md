# SoundCloud Privacy Settings

SoundCloud offers limited privacy settings. [SoundCloud Privacy Information](https://help.soundcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003562388-Changing-your-track-s-privacy-setting)

These privacy settings allow your tracks, albums, and playlists to be added to the Mukurtu media library and accessed by users. Content and media protocols apply. 
- **Public**
- **Private** 

**Scheduled** tracks are only available to paid Artist Pro subscribers. It allows you to schedule when your tracks shift from **Private** to **Public**.

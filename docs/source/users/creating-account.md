# How to Create a New User Account

Creating a new user account in Mukurtu as an administrator is a straightforward process. 
- First, go to People on the top right-hand side of your screen.  
- Click the blue box that says Add user. Enter their username and a generic password on this page. They will change their password when they log in for the first time. You can also choose to add an email address.
- Select their status, depending on whether they should be an Active or Blocked user. If you are creating a new user as an administrator, you should likely select the Active option.
- Check the box to notify the user of their new account. This is not required.
- Administrators have the option to fill in a Display name, photograph, and contact settings for their new user. They can also determine whether they want to subscribe to emails and set their preferred time zone and language display. All of these settings can be changed by the user after they log in.

The remaining steps to create a collection are the same.

## Steps to create a collection 

We will start with filling out the information contained in the **Mukurtu Essentials** tab. 

1. Select the *Collection name* field. Fill in a name for your collection.

2. Select a sharing setting and applicable cultural protocols. Sharing setting has two options: you can select **Any** or **All**. Any is the less restrictive setting as it means that the content can be shared with people belonging to any one or more of the protocols selected. All is more restrictive as users must belong to all the protocols selected to view the collection.

> Collection name, sharing settings, and cultural protocols are required fields.

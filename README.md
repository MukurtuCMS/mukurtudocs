## Contributing to the User Manual

If you notice something that could be improved, we would love your help. 

- This is documentation for ordinary users, not developers. Please use clear, jargon-free language. 
- Explain every possible step, even the ones which seem obvious. It is better for users to skip a step they've already completed than be confused by a leap they can't follow. Do not assume any prior knowledge of technology on the part of the user for this documentation.
- Break longer tasks up into short paragraphs or lists.
- Use illustrative images when needed, especially to indicate which button or link users should engage with.

If you are cloning the user manuals to your local computer and creating a branch, you may wish to [install and use MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/#installation) to preview your changes and ensure the formatting and syntax are correct.
